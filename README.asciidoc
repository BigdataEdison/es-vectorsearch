# Similarity search on vector fields with ElasticSearch

experimenting with elasticsearch features for vector fields

## Setup

- clone and build elasticsearch to get a current snapshot version docker image
- run `docker-compose up`
- `./mvnw package -Pdownload` to build the application with the *download* profile to get the glove word embeddings
- run the built jar, then type "import" in the shell for an initial import of the words into elaticsearch
- type `similar --to <word>` in the shell to see similar words
